# Increased-Rainfall
This simple C program will allow the user to determine which months in a certain year had the greatest amount of rainfall.
This program contains 3 functions:
- DisplayInstructions();
- HigherRainfall();
- DisplayAnswers();

The DisplayAnswers() function will give the user a brief description of what this program is all about.
The HigherRainfall() function will calculate the months with the largest rainfall.
The DisplayAnswers() function will then output the results.

The program will then give the user the option to repeat the process.
